Digital Coffee

Why not the Netherlands!? I can imagine the Netherlands would not be the first country you think off when dreaming about your future. But maybe i can change that!

Off course there are many options for you as an experienced Software professional, and perhaps you are quite happy at your current employer, but if you would be so kind to spend 30 minutes of your time with me, i can give you a good idea about the options the Netherlands can give you (short and longer term)We as Xelvin provide recruitment assistance for international candidates whom are open for the change to start living and working in the Netherlands.Does this sound interesting for you? And would you be open to discuss these opportunities? I would like to invite you for a digital coffee :)
